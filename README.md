This is Take-John, pronounced as “Také-John”, a university student in Japan.  
I am learning C, Java, JavaScript and Python.

Currently my interest is developing plugins of SpigotMC, an extention of Minecraft servers.  
I also interested in Skript, a language to create plugins easily than Java.

I love to help others!
